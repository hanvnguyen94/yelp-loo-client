# Yelp-Loo Web App

This full-stack application can be viewed as a clone of yelp.com . It has two resources which are user and loos(bathrooms). The user will be able to create an account and organize their "public bathroom" online, which stores all related information like photos and addresses.

## Planning Story
This project was created with logic steps as below:
- Create User Stories
- Create Wire Frames
- Create ERD (Entity RelationShip Diagram)
- Set Up HTML and GitHub repositories for front-end and back-end files
- Make API routes
- Make curl scripts to test API
- Debug API
- Make Client Site
- Connect API with Client
- Debugging both sites
- Final Touches

## User Stories

### Version 1:
- As a user, I want to Sign Up/ Sign In/ Change Password and Sign Out
- As a user, I want to store my own user's information (name, email, password)
- As a user, I want to create a new bathroom (with photo, location, description, and create reviews maybe?)
- As a user, I want to view all bathrooms list
- As a user, I want to edit a specific bathroom's information
- As a user, I want to delete a specific bathroom

### Version 2:
- One user can view all users bathrooms
- One user can post a comment, also can edit or delete that comment as well
- Use 3rd API party to display the map of the bathrooms based on a given location


## Technologies

## Unsolved Problems
